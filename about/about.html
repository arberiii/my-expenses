I'm Arber Avdullahu, click in img for FB profile.<br /> This is a stupid app, I mean everyone has access to CRUD the expenses and payments and a lot of things aren't finished?! <br> Yes, you right I made this app just for fun to practice my knowledge on AngularJS, Firebase and Foundation, there is still a lot to develop on the future but for now it's okay.
